## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Step-1:
To install the wazuh agent on our endpoint(windows-machine)<br>
We go to the wazuh official website to download the package (exe-file)<br>
It is recommended to install the exefile the gui version for easier installation.<br>
After the download has completed.<br>
Run the wazuh-agent.exe file on the endpoint<br>

![wazuh agent on widows intsall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2815ae3d-0277-46b6-95da-19871f266a43)
After the installation has completed <br>
Check the " Run wazuh agent configuration interface " and click finish<.br>

## Step-2:
In the interface enter the manager ip that is your wazuh ip meaning (cloud ip for connection) and save.<br>
*Ref 2: Agent-interface*
![wazuh agent interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b28c3b16-e3c2-40f9-99a8-48dbdfe2bad6)
After that go in the config view in the view tab <br>
Here we are going to configure the  config file to enable osquery for osquery integration.<br>
*Ref 3: Osquery-config*
![agent windows os query on](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55f1359c-a1b8-496e-acec-ab272b09c5dc)
And in the view tab we can view the logs of the log file that are going to be monitored.<br>
*Ref 4: Agent-logs*

![wazuh agent logs view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8a13c33-2207-4bea-9aad-58e2604636a2)<br>
After restarting the agent the api key will be generated <br>
## Step-3:
Now we check if our agent has connected with the wazuh server<br>
Open the wazuh dashboard on the browser and check the agents.<br>
*Ref 5: wazuh agent status*

![wazuh-dashboard-agent-active](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/905d6421-827b-4627-8294-1500bc215ee0)
On the Dashboard in the top left corner we can see the agent summary and see the active agent.<br>

Here we can see the windows-agent has connected and sending logs.<br>

### Ubuntu-Agent
## Step-1
Now we are going to set up on a linux-virtual-Machine <br>
open the terminal.<br>
Using the following command we can connect the wazuh agent key repo on the machine.<br>
``
apt-get install gnupg apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/ stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list 
``<br>

For debian-7,8 and 14 for other check wazuh agent Documentation.<br>
*Ref 7: agent ubuntu*
![add-repo-ubuntu-cloud](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81c16bd6-3109-43d7-acdb-61aaaf29aaed)

The necessary dependencies will be downloaded.<br>
## Step-2
To connect to Wazuh manager and download wazuh agent use the following command  .<br>
Change the ip to the wazuh cloud ip <br>
``WAZUH_MANAGER="10.0.0.2" apt-get install wazuh-agent``<br>

## Step-3
After the installation is completed .<br>
Using the following command we can configure our machine to start wazuh agent on startup.<br>
``systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-agent
systemctl start wazuh-agent
``<br>

*Ref 8: system ctl command*
![using system ctl for agent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5af2a73d-902a-47f2-a773-149c3902e1b2)
<br>

## Step-4
After the installation has completed and the wazuh agent has started.<br>
We can now go to the wazuh dashboard to check the agent status.<br>
*Ref 9: agent summary*
![dashboard wazuh agents ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8274f0da-fec2-4243-af1c-fa8f5b68a6e5)
Here we can see the agent(endpoint) has connected to the wazuh server .<br>
